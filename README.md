# ChessMoveGen
A library to generate all legal moves for a chess position.

First develop an 0x88 style move generation library and the other tools around it necessary 
to operate.

Then find ways to make it faster (bitboard?).

Generally use ideas/algorithms from others but don't copy the code.
